                <p>I am so convinced that every man needs F3 that I planted the shovel flag here in Danville. <br>
                It is right in my D2X, helping and teaching men to become virtuous <leaders class="br"></leaders>
                It also something I really needed in my life for all 3 F’s. Up until I recently went on the IR 
                I was more fit than I have been in many years. The relationships I’ve developed are the best part.
                My Pax holds me accountable and I get to challenge myself which every man needs. <br>
                I hope to help motivate and encourage other men to keep accelerating in all 3 F’s. <br>
                Out of F3 our High Impact Man podcast was birthed and many men have told us that 
                it has helped them a lot on their lives. <br>
                God has me right where he wants me and I’m living my purpose!

                <p>I was seeking for a young adults group in my area, by this point I was working from home. <br>
                me just starting to work from I did not have a lot of friends, or people in my life at the time. <br>
                I kind of enjoyed locking myself in my room and shutting out the world. <br>
                Prior to F3 I used to do a few miles walking with my mom, but I barely ever ran. I was definitely overweight at 240lbs.<br>
                All of this combined definitely took a toll on my mental health. <br>
                After failing at finding a young adults group I called a few churches, one of them being First Baptist. <br>
                When I asked the question if they had a young adults group, I got the response “Well no, but there is a group of crazy guys that <br>workout in the morning”.
                From there I got Salty’s number and came to my first beatdown in the gloom with you guys!<br>
                From there I can only describe it as what the disciples found when they met Jesus. This group felt like I was meant to be there.<br>
                Not only have you guys accepted me, you have all pushed me not only physically, but spiritually as well. <br>
                I absolutely love this group and everyone in it! Also I am down about 30 lbs and losing by the week
